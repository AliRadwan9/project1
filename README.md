# drawing-software-project
In this project my teammate and i wanted tocreate a simple drawing software.
It allows users to draw on a digital canvas.It provides a color palette menu with selectable colors (white, black, red, yellow, green, blue, magenta)and an eraser button. Users can click and drag to draw on the canvas with their chosen color,and use the eraser to clear pixels. The interface consists of a drawing area and a side menu barcontaining color and eraser buttons.
This program can only be run in the environment of codeboot because of the use of several functions pre-defined in codeboot's environment.
I learned from this project to write clean and self-descriptive code using functions, fitting variable names, and necessary comments. And also writing good test functions for the main functions.
